# ToontownMinigames
Toontown minigames I've created using Toontown School House.

Games to work on:

1. DistributedWatchingGame:

Barebones Version - 99% (except for a single bug which I will rectify soon)

Finalized Version - Not even started, will work on later.

2. ??? - Somewhat planning this for now (no promises), but I think it would be a cool idea if done right, especially in Toontown.

Things I've learned about since starting to work on this:
- Using the DC file to create AI functions that allow communication between the minigame and its AI server.
- Using the taskMgr to execute functions at certain times
- Inserting a new minigame into the Trolley chooser
- Sending updates to the AI to end the game
- loading, rotating, and placing models
- Using CollisionNodes to take in player collisions and executing functions based on those collisions.
- Using various types of Collision Solids including CollisionBoxes and CollisionSpheres
