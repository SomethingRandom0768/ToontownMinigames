# ToontownMinigames
Toontown minigames I've created using Toontown School House.

Games to work on:

1. DistributedWatchingGame - 33% - 1/2 of the mechanics are finished. After mechanics, it's just polish (making the game place look nice, giving a story for the minigame, etc)
2. ??? - Somewhat planning this for now (no promises), but I think it would be a cool idea if done right, especially in Toontown.
