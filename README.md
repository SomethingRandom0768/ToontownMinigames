# ToontownMinigames
Toontown minigames I've created using Toontown School House.

Games to work on:

1. DistributedWatchingGame - 33% - 1/2 of the mechanics are finished. After mechanics, it's just polish (making the game place look nice, giving a story for the minigame, etc)
NOTE: I am not going to push anything anymore until the entire game is finished. Stay TOONed!


2. ??? - Somewhat planning this for now (no promises), but I think it would be a cool idea if done right, especially in Toontown.

Things I've learned about since starting to work on this:
- The DC file
- Using the taskMgr to execute functions at certain times
- Inserting a new minigame into the Trolley chooser
- Sending updates to the AI to end the game
- loading, rotating, and placing models
- Using CollisionNodes to take in player collisions and executing functions based on those collisions.
